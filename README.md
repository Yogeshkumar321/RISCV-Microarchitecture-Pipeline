## üöÄ From Single-Cycle to Pipelined Architecture üöÄ

This repository showcases the Verilog implementation of a RISC-V Pipelined Core, specifically a 5-stage pipeline microarchitecture. The design transitions from a single-cycle concept to a pipelined approach, enabling multiple instructions to be processed concurrently across distinct stages. This parallelism aims to significantly boost clock frequency and overall performance. The core features a robust pipeline structure (Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, and Writeback stages) and incorporates a Hazard Unit for efficient data hazard detection and resolution through forwarding/bypassing mechanisms. The project includes all necessary modules for a functional CPU, such as an ALU, Control Unit, Instruction and Data Memories, Register File, and various multiplexers and adders, along with a testbench for simulation and waveform analysis.

## 1. Project Overview

The core objective of this project is to implement a robust RISC-V pipelined architecture. Pipelining, a cornerstone of modern processor design, divides the instruction execution process into five sequential stages. This allows a new instruction to begin execution in each clock cycle, leading to an approximate five-fold increase in clock frequency compared to a single-cycle design. Our design specifically addresses and resolves data hazards, a common challenge in pipelined processors, through an advanced forwarding mechanism.

## 2. Pipeline Stages

The RISC-V pipeline is meticulously structured into five distinct stages, ensuring efficient instruction throughput:

### 1. Fetch Cycle (`fetch_cycle.v`) üì•

This initial stage is dedicated to fetching the instruction from the Instruction Memory and concurrently advancing the Program Counter (PC).

**Inputs:**
- `clk`: System clock signal
- `rst`: Asynchronous reset signal
- `PCSrcE`: Control signal from the Execute stage, determining if the next PC value is for a branch
- `PCTargetE [31:0]`: The calculated target address for branch instructions, originating from the Execute stage

**Outputs:**
- `InstrD [31:0]`: The fetched 32-bit instruction, passed to the Decode stage
- `PCD [31:0]`: The Program Counter value for the current instruction, forwarded to the Decode stage
- `PCPlus4D [31:0]`: The value of PC + 4, also passed to the Decode stage

**Key Internal Components:**
- **PC_MUX**: A 2-to-1 multiplexer that selects between the incremented PC (PCPlus4F) and the branch target address (PCTargetE) to determine the PC_Next
- **Program_Counter**: A dedicated module that updates the PCF (Program Counter Fetch) on the positive edge of the clock
- **Instruction_Memory**: This memory unit stores the program instructions and provides InstrF based on the PCF address
- **PC_Adder**: Computes PCPlus4F by adding 4 to the current PCF
- **Pipeline Registers**: (InstrF_reg, PCF_reg, PCPlus4F_reg): These registers hold the fetched instruction and PC values, transferring them to the next pipeline stage at the clock edge

### 2. Decode Cycle (`Decode_Cyle.v`) üß†

In this crucial stage, the fetched instruction is deciphered. Register operands are read from the Register File, and any immediate values are sign-extended. The Control Unit generates all necessary control signals for subsequent stages.

- `3'b101` (set less than): Used for slt instruction, checks if A < B (signed comparison), indicated by Sum[31]

*Note: Other ALUControl values are considered "don't care" and their output behavior is not critical to the design's functionality under normal operation.*

### Control Unit (Main Decoder & ALU Decoder) üö¶

The Control Unit is the brain of the processor, generating all necessary control signals for the datapath based on the instruction's fields. It is modularly designed into two sub-units:

#### Main Decoder (`Main_Decoder.v`):

**Inputs:** `Op [6:0]` (the 7-bit opcode of the instruction)

**Outputs:** `RegWrite, ImmSrc [1:0], ALUSrc, MemWrite, ResultSrc, Branch, ALUOp [1:0]`

This decoder is responsible for generating most of the primary control signals based on the opcode. It also determines a 2-bit ALUOp signal, which provides a high-level command to the ALU_Decoder.

**MAIN decoder table:**

**MAIN decoder mapping :**
![MAIN decoder mapping ](Resources/MAINdecodertable.png)


#### ALU Decoder (`ALU_Decoder.v`):

**Inputs:** `ALUOp [1:0], funct3 [2:0], funct7 [6:0], op [6:0]` (full opcode, specifically op[5])

**Output:** `ALUControl [2:0]` (the final 3-bit control signal for the ALU)

This decoder uses the ALUOp signal along with the instruction's funct3 and funct7 fields (and op[5]) to compute the precise ALUControl signal required by the ALU.

### Register File (`Register_File.v`) üóÉÔ∏è

A critical component storing the processor's general-purpose registers (32 x 32-bit registers).

**Inputs:** `clk, rst, WE3` (write enable for port 3), `WD3 [31:0]` (write data for port 3), `A1 [4:0], A2 [4:0]` (read addresses for ports 1 and 2), `A3 [4:0]` (write address for port 3)

### Sign Extend (`Sign_Extend.v`) ‚ÜîÔ∏è

Extends smaller immediate values to 32 bits, correctly preserving their signed magnitude.

**Inputs:** `In [31:0]` (input immediate, typically 12 or 20 bits are relevant), `ImmSrc [1:0]` (immediate source type control)

**Output:** `Imm_Ext [31:0]` (the 32-bit sign-extended immediate)

**ImmSrc controls the extension logic based on the instruction type:**
- `2'b00`: Extends In[31:20] for I-type instructions (e.g., lw, addi)
- `2'b01`: Concatenates In[31:25] and In[11:7] (for S-type and B-type immediates) and then sign-extends

## 4. Instruction Formats Supported

The RISC-V processor is designed to support a core subset of the RISC-V instruction set, categorized by their distinct formats:

### R-Type Instructions: (Register-type) üìã

These instructions operate exclusively on three registers: two source (rs1, rs2) and one destination (rd).

**Fields:** funct7 (7 bits), rs2 (5 bits), rs1 (5 bits), funct3 (3 bits), rd (5 bits), op (7 bits)

- The primary opcode for all R-type instructions is 33 (`7'b0110011`)
- The specific operation is further defined by the funct3 and funct7 fields

**Examples:** ADD, SUB, SLL, SLT, SLTU, XOR, SRL, SRA, OR, AND

![R-type instructions](Resources/Rtypeinstructions.png)

### I-Type Instructions: (Immediate-type) üìä

I-type instructions utilize two register operands (rs1, rd) and a 12-bit immediate value (imm).

**Fields:** imm[11:0] (12 bits), rs1 (5 bits), funct3 (3 bits), rd (5 bits), op (7 bits)

- rs1 and the imm are always used as source operands, while rd serves as the destination register
- The operation is determined by a combination of the opcode and the funct3 field
- Immediate values are sign-extended to 32 bits to accommodate operations with 32-bit base registers (e.g., lw adds a 12-bit offset to a 32-bit base register)

**Examples:** LB, LH, LW, LBU, LHU, ADDI, SLTI, SLTIU, XORI, ORI, ANDI, SLLI, SRLI, SRAI

![I-type instructions](Resources/Itypeinsructions.png)

### S-Type Instructions: (Store-type) üì¶

S-type instructions are designed for memory store operations, using two register operands (rs1, rs2) and a 12-bit immediate operand (imm).

**Fields:** imm[11:5] (7 bits), rs2 (5 bits), rs1 (5 bits), funct3 (3 bits), imm[4:0] (5 bits), op (7 bits)

- rs1, rs2, and the imm are all treated as source operands
- The 12-bit immediate for store instructions is uniquely split across two fields within the instruction word (Instr[31:25] and Instr[11:7])
- These are then concatenated and sign-extended for use in address calculation

**Examples:** SB, SH, SW

![S-type instructions](Resources/Stypeinstructions.png)

### B-Type Instructions: (Branch-type) ‚û°Ô∏è

This format is exclusively used by branch instructions, operating on two register operands (rs1, rs2) and a 12-bit immediate operand (imm).

**Fields:** imm[12,10:5] (7 bits), rs2 (5 bits), rs1 (5 bits), funct3 (3 bits), imm[4:1,11] (5 bits), op (7 bits)

- rs1, rs2, and the imm are specified as operands
- Similar to S-type, the 12-bit immediate is split and needs to be reconstructed and sign-extended

**Examples:** BEQ, BNE, BLT, BGE, BLTU, BGEU

![B-type instructions](Resources/Btypeinstructions.png)


## 5. Signal Conventions üö•

To maintain clarity and consistency throughout the Verilog modules and architectural diagrams, the following signal conventions are adopted:

- **Thick Lines (Black/Grey)**: Denotes 32-bit data buses, signifying full data words
- **Medium Lines (Black/Grey)**: Represents narrower buses, such as the 5-bit address lines used for the register file
- **Thin Blue Lines**: Indicates control signals, which typically carry 1-bit or few-bit control information (e.g., write enable signals)

**Suffix Conventions:**
- **Suffix _F (Fetch)**: Signals related to the Fetch stage, such as PCF (Program Counter Fetch) or PCPlus4F
- **Suffix _D (Decode)**: Signals originating from or relevant to the Decode stage, including InstrD (Instruction for Decode) and PCD (PC for Decode)
- **Suffix _E (Execute)**: Signals passed to or generated within the Execute stage, for instance, RegWriteE, ALUSrcE, and ALUControlE
- **Suffix _M (Memory)**: Signals passed to or generated within the Memory stage, such as RegWriteM, MemWriteM, and ALU_ResultM
- **Suffix _W (Writeback)**: Signals pertinent to the Writeback stage, including RegWriteW, ResultSrcW, and ResultW
- **Suffix _r (Register)**: Used for internal pipeline registers that hold values between stages (e.g., RegWriteD_r)

## 6. Simulation Setup üñ•Ô∏è

The project includes a comprehensive testbench (`pipeline_tb.v`) designed to simulate the behavior of the pipelined RISC-V core.

**Clock (clk)**: The system clock toggles every 50 time units, defining the pipeline's timing.

**Reset (rst)**: An active-low asynchronous reset signal. It is initially asserted (`1'b0`) for 200 time units, then deasserted (`1'b1`) to begin normal operation.

**Waveform Dump**: The simulation generates a `dump.vcd` file. This Value Change Dump (VCD) file contains all signal transitions during the simulation, enabling detailed waveform analysis.

**GTKWave Configuration**: A pre-configured GTKWave waveform display file, `pipeline.gtkw`, is provided. This file allows for easy loading and visualization of key signals and pipeline registers, offering an intuitive way to observe the processor's state changes.

### To run the simulation and view waveforms:

1. **Compile the Verilog files** using your preferred HDL simulator (e.g., Icarus Verilog). Ensure all Verilog modules are included in the compilation command:

```bash
iverilog -o pipeline_sim Pipeline_Top.v pipeline_tb.v ALU.v ALU_Decoder.v Control_Unit_Top.v Data_Memory.v Decode_Cyle.v Execute_Cycle.v Fetch_Cycle.v Hazard_unit.v Instruction_Memory.v Main_Decoder.v Memory_Cycle.v Mux.v PC.v PC_Adder.v Register_File.v Sign_Extend.v Writeback_Cycle.v
```

2. **Execute the compiled simulation:**

```bash
vvp pipeline_sim
```

This command will run the simulation and generate the `dump.vcd` file.

3. **Open the waveforms in GTKWave:**

```bash
gtkwave dump.vcd pipeline.gtkw
```

This will launch GTKWave with the VCD file loaded and the signals pre-arranged according to `pipeline.gtkw`.

## 7. Waveform Analysis üìà

After running the simulation, you can analyze the `dump.vcd` file using GTKWave. Below you can insert a screenshot of the waveform output and provide an observational description of the key signal behaviors during the simulation.

*[Insert PNG image of the waveform output from GTKWave here]*

### Observational Description:

- **Initial Reset Behavior**: Observe how the `rst` signal affects the pipeline registers and PC. All registers should initialize to 0 when `rst` is 0.

- **Instruction Flow**: Trace an instruction (e.g., `00500293` or `00300313` from `memfile.hex`) through each pipeline stage by observing the `InstrD`, `InstrE`, `InstrM`, `InstrW` (if internal signals are dumped for instructions in each stage) and related data/control signals (`PCD`, `PCE`, `PCPlus4D`, `PCPlus4E`, `ALU_ResultM`, `ResultW`, etc.).

- **Pipelining in Action**: Notice how multiple instructions are active in different pipeline stages simultaneously, demonstrating the parallelism of the design.

- **Hazard Resolution**: If any data hazards occur with the provided `memfile.hex`, observe how the `ForwardAE` and `ForwardBE` signals from the Hazard Unit become active, and how the ALU input multiplexers (`srca_mux`, `srcb_mux`) select forwarded data instead of stalled data from the register file.

- **Register File Writes**: Track `RegWriteW`, `RDW`, and `ResultW` to verify that results are written back correctly to the destination registers.

- **Memory Accesses**: For load/store instructions, observe the `ALU_ResultM` (address), `WriteDataM` (for stores), `MemWriteM`, and `ReadDataW` (for loads) signals interacting with the Data_Memory module.
